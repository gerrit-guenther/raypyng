'''A couple of things to keep in mind:
 - when we rteace we want to check if the file was 
   already traced and exported, or if we have to do it
 - we put the simulations in a list called result: 
   what happens if we have millions of simulations?
 - we are passing rml to both the SimulationParams class 
   and to the Simulation class. 
   This might generate some errors, can we avoid it?
